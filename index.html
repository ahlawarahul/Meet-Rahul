                  <br />A. Various data metrics were measured and gathered over a period of 1 month across all the support teams. These included Avg. time to resolve tickets, Avg. ticket backlog, SLAs or SLOs, distribution of tickets from critical to
                  low priority.
                  <br />B. A deep-dive was done into all the processes, customer experience using the technology and the various engagement channels - phone, chat, email, etc.
                  <br />C. In addition, shadowing of support associates was conducted to understand where inefficiencies if any could by identified and resolved.
                  <br />D. Using the data gathered, specific changes were made to set simplified and consolidated processes, and standard metrics for all the support teams. In addition, associates were re-organized to balance the teams according the
                  complexity of product supported and no. of tickets, client importance, etc.
                  <br />E. The support teams were more closely integrated with the engineering teams to understand new features as they were released, and build a knowledge base for those, thus reducing time to resolve tickets.
                  <br />F. Finally, teams were migrated to a new support platform which provided a uniform experience to all external users and the support team, as well as making platform maintenance simplified.

                  meant that external users had a better user experience as well (for e.g. being able to use chat which wasn't available earlier for each product supported). A tighter relationship with the engineering teams, and the existence of a
                  knowledge base helped the associates tackle tickets in a more efficient manner. Six months after the 'go-live' the NPS was measured at 8, a clear improvement over the original 5 and the targeted goal of 7.</p>

                <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Business Context</h3>
                <p class="project_detail_p_text">The organization was small-sized, and wanted to improve its overall lab inventory management processes through the use of technology. Lack of a good platform to manage inventory data and
                  effective reporting caused unpredictable shortages, and hampered the ability to conduct clinical testing and deliver results under contracted SLAs, leading to end-client (hospital org) impact and potential loss of business to competition.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="project_modal_text_section1">
                <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Key Challenge</h3>
                <p class="project_detail_p_text">The organization wanted a solution stood up in a short time (4 months) that would ensure the lab testing delays reduced from the existing 5% down to 2% due to inventory shortages. Not achieving this target would have a direct implication with upcoming renewals for sizeable B2B clients. The existing management processes were almost entirely manual, and not well documented. Lastly, given the organization's small size, cost had to be controlled.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="project_modal_text_section2">
                <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Applied Efforts</h3>
                <p class="project_detail_p_text">With two key targets necessary to be accomplished, i.e. time to deliver and impact on delays, it was important to have an approach that focused on delivering the 'must-haves' vs the 'good-to-haves'.
                  <br />A. To begin, key processes were documented and captured as requirements first. These laid the foundation of what the platform solution needed to support.
                  <br />B. A Hybrid-Agile delivery approach was applied to allow a quick start to the implementation as well as to allow for some level of change during the course of implementation but not risking the overall timeline.
                  <br />C. Business managers and key users were designated as product-owners to ensure the functionality was built not just to meet the high-level targets but also to provide a decent level of usability. They were key participants in
                  user acceptance testing (UAT).
                  <br />D. Requirements were marked as 'MVP - Minimum Viable Product' or identified as 'Good-to-have' in which case they'd be tackled in the future via a separate project or release, and agreed as such with the stakeholders.
                  <br />E. Finally, in order to manage the project to the limited budget, an open-source technology was used with an engineering team that was confident with it.

              <div class="project_modal_text_section3">
                <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Result</h3>
                <p class="project_detail_p_text">With a keen focus on timing and feature development to drive effective management of inventory, the platform was stood up in 4 months, as targeted. Its functionality provided views into incoming
                  inventory, consumed inventory, rate of consumption and recommendations on re-ordering, etc. Everything was recorded in near-real time through integration with bar code scanners used to track the inventory as it arrived and was
                  consumed. Within 6 weeks, the organization saw a reduction in delays to 1%, beating the target of 2%. With specific add-on changes to the processes and recommendation engines, this was further brought down to 0% eventually.</p>

                    <p class="project_detail_p_text">The organization had operations that were spread globally given its expansion through part acquisition and part organic growth. It wanted the ability to centrally oversee and manage technology procurement requests as well as to be cost-efficient and standardized/consolidated in terms of the technology solutions used globally.</p>

                    <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Key Challenge</h3>
                    <p class="project_detail_p_text">The business was very large and quite widespread with presence in 7 global 'zones'. Each of these had different processes and models in addition to people & other stakeholders who managed technology procurement. All of these had to be aligned to a common governance model.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="project_modal_text_section2">
                    <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Applied Efforts</h3>
                    <p class="project_detail_p_text">Standardization of technology management & procurement required the establishment of a central, Technology Governance function. To stand up this function -
<br />A. The org model was identified first, which included a Steering Committee that would be headed by the Chief Enterprise Architect, overseen by the CIO and have POCs from each of the global zones (usually a Director level person).
<br />B. Secondly, interviews were conducted to understand existing procurement processes driving technology purchase decisions, as well as key constraints that drove them (such as budget, category of product, timeliness to procure, etc.).
<br />C. A map of all the technology platforms/solutions used across the globe was built. This was used as a starting point to help stakeholders understand the level of fragmentation and the need to standardize and govern these processes.
<br />D. Using the information gathered, a new process model was defined for the Governance function, taking into consideration the constraints and variations applicable to each business unit, and aligned with the designated POCs on the Steering Committee.
<br />E. Once defined, the POCs then took the new model and work within their zones/units to implement it and provide feedback that would help continually refine it.

                    <h3 class="project_detail_h3">Result</h3>
                    <p class="project_detail_p_text">There was some level of expected resistance from specific business units given the shift in governance/decision control and level of change to procurement. However, working in a collaborative fashion with the POCs and other stakeholders, the new model was made effective in 3 months. The organization started getting the benefits of the centralized governance in how technology was sourced, driving consolidation and savings of about $3.5M total over the next 2 years.</p>
